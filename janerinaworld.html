 <h1>Janerinaworld</h1>
 <p>A journey that began in 1995 — experiences gathered along the way</p>
</header>

<section class="timeline">

 <div class="section">
   <h2>Chapter 1 — The Beginning</h2>

   <p>
     My journey began in <strong>May 1995</strong>, arriving in <strong>Mumbai</strong> on an early-morning
     <strong>Karnavati Express</strong>. The city was still waking up — quiet platforms, soft light,
     and the sense of something about to begin.
   </p>

   <p>
     We had left home around <strong>4:00 a.m.</strong>, the hour when streets are empty and thoughts feel
     heavier than luggage. Sitting beside my father, the journey carried more than distance.
     It carried intention.
   </p>

   <div class="quote">
     “Some journeys start quietly, yet leave lasting impressions.”
   </div>

   <p>
     The train journey lasted about <strong>five hours</strong>. It was a <strong>Sunday</strong>,
     unhurried and gentle. We shared simple sandwiches, watched the scenery pass,
     and enjoyed the rhythm of the rails.
   </p>

   <p>
     We got down at <strong>Borivali</strong> and took a cab to <strong>Andheri</strong>, to my uncle’s home.
     The house was empty — keys collected from the neighbors. We rested,
     letting the movement of the morning settle into stillness.
   </p>

   <p>
     After lunch, we visited the <strong>Deshpande family</strong> in <strong>Prabhadevi</strong>.
     Conversations flowed easily — about families, work, plans, and futures.
     Tea and snacks were served, and we left with quiet clarity.
   </p>

   <p>
     The next morning, we set out early again — this time to <strong>Chembur</strong>.
     I wore a simple brick-orange kurta with a dupatta.
     We walked through busy streets lined with small shops and residential buildings,
     finally reaching <strong>Balaka</strong>, a building named after a group of swans.
   </p>

   <p>
     Inside, the home was bright and welcoming. The boy sat beside my father,
     dressed in a white and blue striped shirt, speaking with ease and intelligence.
     His sister, visiting from Australia, shared family stories.
     His mother prepared pohe and tea.
   </p>

   <div class="quote">
     “Sometimes, clarity comes quietly — in conversation and presence.”
   </div>

   <p>
     We returned to Andheri around noon. At <strong>2:00 p.m.</strong>, the phone rang.
     The Joshi family had already decided — they wished to move ahead.
     The decision came swiftly, unexpectedly.
   </p>

   <p>
     We went to the STD booth to share the news with my mother.
     Her first question was simple: <em>Did you like the boy?</em>
     I said yes.
   </p>

   <p>
     That evening, both families agreed.
     The engagement was set for the coming Thursday.
     What had begun as a quiet Sunday journey was now moving purposefully
     toward something new.
   </p>

   <h2>Chapter 2 — Coming Soon</h2>
   <p>The journey continues. Chapter 2 will be added here.</p>
